			Persona Story: Vineet
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> As Vineet, I google "bike" in order to find a website to purchase bikes</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I click on "amazon.com", because I know it's a reliable site</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I look for advanced options on the left, so that I can limit the number of bikes shown to me to only relevant ones</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I choose option "Men", because I am straight and I want a man's bike (i.e. bikes designed for men)</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I choose option "aluminum and carbon", because I am carrying my bike upstairs, and steel would be too much a labor to do so. </li>
			<li> As Vineet, I google "bike wheel size guide", because I am not certain what wheel size suits my height</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I pick option "29inches", because that fits my height best</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I do not pick a brand, because I do not care too much about brands</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I did not pick "number of gears", because I am not interested in fancy gear changing properties</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I pick "15-20 lbs" and "20-25 lbs", because these seem to be reasonable weight for a bike to me</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I look for "avg. customer review" to be four stars and up, because I don't want a low-quality bike</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I set my price range to be 200-500 dollars, because I want it to be good quality and not too expensive</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I look through the results, and picked a grey one that looks good to me, because I don't want it too look fancy, and I don't want it to stand out (because I lost my last bike)</li>
			<li> As Vinnet, I look for a bike with a back stand, so that I can install a basket on it.
			<li> As Vineet, I look through the gallery of images, because I care about the look</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I scroll down to read customer reviews, because I value what others think of the product</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I look through "Customers... also viewed", because I want to know what other popular options are out there</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I pick other bikes and repeat the above three steps, because I do not want to limit my choices to one</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I compare the price, reviews, features and looks of the bikes, because I want to get the most money-efficient bike that appeal to me out of the group</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I decide on a bike, because I understand I'm going to buy one on this site</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I select the size (and color), because I am prompted to do so, and I understand choosing the correct ones will keep me from complaining in the future</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I add my choice to cart, because that is how I remember onlining shopping should proceed</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I click on the "cart" icon, because I believe doing so will lead my to my virtual cart that contains my bike</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I briefly review my choice of bike, price and quantity, because I want to make sure I did not make any mistakes before I make my purchase</li>
			<li> As Vineet, I click on "proceed to checkout", because I think this tab will lead me to my check-out process</li>
