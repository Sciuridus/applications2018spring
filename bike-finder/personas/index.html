				Vineet
			</h2>	
			<ul>
				<li>Vineet is a 32-yr old male. He works as a marketing consultant for a software company in Portland, OR. </li>
				<li>Vineet lives in a downtown 5-story apartment, and he lives on the second floor. Vineet is renting the apartment with a roommate, who does not own a car.</li>
				 <li>The apartment does not have an elevator, and it does not have a public bike rack/garage (i.e. Vineet needs to carry his bike home everyday).</li>
				<li>Vineet works out at a local gym two-days a week, and he is relatively fit.</li>
				<li>Vineet owns a car, but rides to work due to parking limitations. Vineet’s company is a 10-min ride from home, and there is no public transportation from Vineet’s apartment to his office building.</li>
				<li>Vineet’s previous bike is stolen, so he needs another.</li>
				<li>Vineet has knowledge of bikes, and he knows how to ride one.</li>
				<li>Vineet does not desire a fancy bike (looks and functionality), but he also does not want it to be too cheaply build/looking. </li>
				<li>Vineet wants his bike to be money-efficient.</li>
				<li>Vineet wants a basket on the bike to place his briefcase.</li>
